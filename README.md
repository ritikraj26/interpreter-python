This project follows the book
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.

In this project I've build an interpreter for
[Lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html), a simple
scripting language. This includes tokenization, ASTs,
tree-walk interpreters and more.


# To Run

   `app/main.py`.
